### Before you begin

Ensure at least one connector and data model are set up before creating a workflow.

In this example, we use BigQuery integration with a contact data model.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Segment Builder">
    ![](/images/Screenshot2025-03-13170451.png)

    Go to the Segments workspace home screen and click **'Add Segment'** to open the Segment Builder, where you can configure all settings for your new segment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your Segment">
    The **Segment Builder** consists of two key steps:

    1. **Define Your Segment** – Start by naming your segment and providing a clear description of its purpose. This helps in organizing and understanding the segment’s intent, especially for automation and reporting.

    2. **Set Up Segment Criteria** – Define filtering conditions. These criteria determine which corporate clients will be included in the segment.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuring the Criteria">
    **Adding Filter**s

    1. Click on "**+Add Condition**"

    2. You'll see a drop down of entities from your existing database. Once an entity is selected, you can only apply filters based on the attributes within that table.

    3. Use filters to define specific rules for your segment.

    4. Click **"+ Add filter"** to apply additional rules within the same table.

    5. **Note:** Multiple filters within the same condition are always combined using an **AND operator**, meaning all conditions must be met.

    **Adding Conditions (optional)**

    1. To apply rules from a different entity, click **"+ Add condition"** and select the desired entity.

    2. You can choose whether **ALL** or **ANY** of these conditions should be met by adjusting the logic within the **grey box** labeled **"Meet All/Any of the following criteria."**

    **Condition Grouping (optional)**

    1. For more precise targeting, use **"+ Add Group"** to create a separate set of conditions.

    2. The **outer condition selector** (**Meet All/Any**) determines the logic between multiple groups.

    3. Inside each group, you can **add more conditions** and apply independent filtering rules.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review your Segment set">
    Click on **"Output Table"** tab to preview the clients that match your defined criteria. This allows you to verify that the queried results align with the **filters and conditions** you set. Ensure the data accurately reflects your segmentation rules before proceeding.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy your segment">
    Once you're satisfied with the output:

    * Click **"Deploy"** to activate your segment and begin running it.

    * Or, click **"Save & Close"** to **save it as a draft** for future modifications or deployment.
  </Step>
