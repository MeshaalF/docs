Although templates streamline workflow creation for common use cases, some organizations may need to map a unique business process. In such cases, starting with an empty workflow canvas is recommended.

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a workflow from scratch, starting with only the Start Node as the foundation.

### Before you begin

Ensure at least one connector and data model are set up before creating a workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Select Agent Page">
    Go to the Agents workspace home screen and click **'Create Agent'** to open the Select Agent page, where you can view all predefined templates.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Agent">
    Click on the **"+ New Agent"** card to begin creating a new workflow. You will be prompted to **enter a title** and **provide a description** for your workflow.

    Once these details are entered, an **empty workflow canvas** will be created, ready for you to configure and customize according to your business requirements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build your Agent">
    **Adding Nodes to Your Workflow**

    * The Start Node is automatically added as the entry point for nodes entering the workflow.

    * Click on the (+) button to add additional nodes.

    * A list of available nodes will appear on the left, each with a description of its function.

    * Customize the workflow by adding and configuring additional nodes based on your business logic.

    * Enter all required settings to ensure proper execution.

    **Workflow Builder Structure**

    The workflow builder consists of two primary sections:

    * Left Panel – Nodes: This section contains the building blocks of the workflow. Nodes define the steps, logic, and execution method, determining whether the workflow runs in real-time, on a schedule, or based on specific triggers.

    * Right Panel – Node Settings: When you click on a node, its configuration settings will appear here. Each node has its own parameters that must be entered to complete the workflow setup before deployment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy your Agent">
    Once all nodes have been configured and their required information is completed, you can proceed with finalizing your workflow.

    1. Click **"Deploy"** to activate the workflow.

    2. Alternatively, click **"Save & Close"** to save it as a draft for future modifications or deployment.

    This ensures that your workflow is fully set up and ready for execution, whether immediately or at a later stage.
